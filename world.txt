From the CLI, fetch a list of all the remote branches:

git fetch

Create a new local branch and link it to the remote branch:
(More precisely the code reads as 'checkout' to a 'new branch' called 'test' that’s linked to 'origin/test'.)
('checkout' basically means 'switch to' - eg "git checkout master" means switch to branch 'master')

git checkout -b test origin/test

We can see what local branches are available to us by running the following:

git branch

While we’re on the 'master' branch, we can merge the commits on the 'test' branch into the master branch thus:

git merge test
